PROJECT #1: Memory Game

This is a standard concentration memory game built with Javascript/jQuery.

I built a 4x4 grid of squares with 8 pairs of images.

Players click on images...two for each turn to flip the squares and see the images. 

One player mode:
Find all the pairs in as few moves as possible.

Two player mode:

player who finds the most pairs wins the game.
