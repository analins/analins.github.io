### PROJECT #1: Emoji Memory Game

This is a standard concentration memory game built with Javascript/jQuery ./project_folder/scripts.js.

I built a 4x4 grid of squares with 8 pairs of images.

Players click on images...two for each turn to flip the squares and see the images.


**One Player Mode:**
Find all the pairs in as few moves as possible.

**Two Player Mode:**
Two players take turns.
Player who finds the most pairs wins the game.

**Approach**
I began by creating mockups of what I wanted the game to look like, and the stages of what I wanted it to do (./mockup/)
I also began to 'Pseudocode' the logic.
I set everything up with html and css...in order to get a clear visual of what I was doing and the space I was doing it in.
I coded different parts of the game that I knew I would need at some point (i.e. array of images, creating the square grid, etc.)because stringing everything together initially seemed impossible, so I started with smaller parts.
I pieced my functions together so they would do what I wanted them to do.


**Unsolved Problems**
CSS: Keeping everything perfectly centered at all times.
JS: Reset function
I realized towards the end that maybe using constructor functions would have maybe been more efficient.
